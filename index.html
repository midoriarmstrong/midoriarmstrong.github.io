  <h2>Web Developer at GatewayiQ</h2>
  
  <p>Currently, I'm working as a web developer at GatewayiQ.</p> 
  <p>I'm working with PHP, HTML5, Sass, and JQuery UI in conjunction with the Laravel framework to help create a 
  social network for businesses. I've successfully implemented a theming system using user-uploaded sprite sheets.</p>
  
  <h2>QA Analyst at SurfEasy Inc.</h2>
  
  <p>I worked at the VPN company SurfEasy Inc. (subsidiary of Opera Software) for four months as a QA Analyst.</p>
  <p>I learned JavaScript and its testing utility CasperJS independently to develop automation code to test their website. 
  I also became familiar with the  continuous integration tool Jenkins as I configured it to run this code. 
  Furthermore, I developed batch and shell scripts outside of work hours to improve efficiency in manual testing. 
  I wrote and executed comprehensive test cases for manual testing as well, based on product requirements documents.</p>
  
  <h2>Contract Developer at Sparhawk Software</h2>
  
  <h3>AMQP message subscriber and JSON parser</h3>
  
  <p>I created an AMQP message subscriber in C using <a href="https://qpid.apache.org/releases/qpid-proton-0.12.0/">v0.12.0</a> 
  of the Apache Qpid Proton library. The subscriber allows users to input the broker address, username, password, 
  and terminus name as command line inputs to subscriber to a message broker. I wrote a full JSON parser for the subscriber, 
  including parsing date/time input into a more readable form.)</p>
