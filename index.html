  <h2>About</h2>
  
  <p>Hello there! My name is Midori Armstrong. I'm a current Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.
  At the moment, I'm on my 2A academic term.</p>
  
  <p>I have a keen interest in software, and I'm always looking to learn more. I have work experience with <strong>PHP, JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>C</strong>, 
  but I'm also familiar with Java, C++, and batch and shell scripting. On the more front-end side of things, I've worked with <strong>HTML5, CSS3, Sass</strong> 
  (and SCSS), <strong>JQuery</strong>, and <strong>JQueryUI</strong>. I also have testing experience with <strong>Codeception</strong> and <strong>PHPunit</strong> for PHP, and with CasperJS for JavaScript.</p>
  
  <p>Check out my <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/midori-armstrong-19433012b">LinkedIn</a> and my <a href="/assets/files/midoriarmstrong-resume.pdf">r&#233;sum&#233;</a> for more info.</p>
  
  <p>Feel free to contact me through the form at the bottom of the page, by phone at (604) 783-7418, 
  by email at <a href="mailto:midoriarmstrong@gmail.com">midoriarmstrong@gmail.com</a>, 
  or by Skype at midori.armstrong if you have any questions.</p>

  <h2>Projects</h2>  
  
  <h3>This Website</h3>
  
  <p>This website was designed and created entirely by myself, hosted through Github Pages. <strong>No</strong> base templates were used. 
  All image assets, excepting the Github and LinkedIn logos above, were created by myself. Originally written in plain HTML and CSS, 
  it was later refactored to use Sass and Liquid templating via Jekyll. It also uses some JavaScript and JQuery.</p>
  
  <p>The site is written to follow semantic HTML principles and features a responsive UI; it is fully functional on desktop, mobile, and tablet.</p>
  
  <p>Source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/midoriarmstrong/midoriarmstrong.github.io">this github repository.</a></p>
  
  <h3>RSA-related Discrete Math Tools</h3>
  
  <p>I wrote code to encrypt and decrpyt messages using RSA, as well as generate new keys. The original code, written in Java, can be found 
  <a href="https://github.com/midoriarmstrong/rsa-encrypt-decrpyt">here</a>.</p>
  
  <p>I then took part of the above code, rewrote it in JavaScript, and extracted some methods to create stand-alone tools to solve a few 
  discrete math-related problems with full steps. It can be viewed <a href="/discrete-math">here</a>.
  The RSA encryption and decryption was not duplicated due to issues in JavaScript with dealing with numbers that were too large.</p>

  <h2>Work Experience</h2>
  
  <h3>Web Developer at GatewayiQ</h3>
  
  <p>I worked with PHP, HTML5, Sass, and JQuery UI in conjunction with the Laravel framework to help create a 
  social network for businesses. Code was written to follow the Model-View-Controller software design pattern 
  and object-oriented programming principles. Data was stored in the Neo4j graph database and queried with Cypher. 
  I successfully implemented a theming system that supports CSS stylesheets, 
  default avatar sprite sheets and icon sprite sheets. I additionally implemented a system to allow users with administrative privileges 
  to add custom info fields under user information, such as an "e-mail" field or a "job title" field.</p>
  
  <h3>QA Analyst at SurfEasy Inc.</h3>
  
  <p>I worked at the VPN company SurfEasy Inc. (subsidiary of Opera Software) for four months as a QA Analyst.</p>
  <p>I learned JavaScript and its testing utility CasperJS independently to develop automation code to test their website. 
  I also became familiar with the  continuous integration tool Jenkins as I configured it to run this code. 
  Furthermore, I developed batch and shell scripts outside of work hours to improve efficiency in manual testing. 
  I wrote and executed comprehensive test cases for manual testing as well, based on product requirements documents.</p>
  
  <h3>Contract Developer at Sparhawk Software</h3>
  
  <h4>AMQP message subscriber and JSON parser</h4>
  
  <p>I created an AMQP message subscriber in C using <a href="https://qpid.apache.org/releases/qpid-proton-0.12.0/">v0.12.0</a> 
  of the Apache Qpid Proton library. The subscriber allows users to input the broker address, username, password, 
  and terminus name as command line inputs to subscriber to a message broker. I wrote a full JSON parser for the subscriber, 
  including parsing date/time input into a more readable form.)</p>
